Strategy Pattern

Overview

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

This implementation adheres to SOLID principles for improved maintainability and extensibility.

Participants

Strategy Interface (fly_behavior.py): Defines the common interface for all supported algorithms (strategies).
Concrete Strategies (fly_with_wings.py, fly_no_way.py): Implement different variations of the algorithm.
Context (duck.py): Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates its behavior to the current strategy.
Client (main.py): Dynamically configures the strategy to be used by the context.

How It Works

Client configures the Duck (context) with a specific FlyBehavior (strategy).
The Duck delegates the flying behavior to the currently set strategy.
The behavior can be changed dynamically at runtime.

Benefits of Strategy Pattern

Open/Closed Principle: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code.
Single Responsibility Principle: The context class delegates specific behavior to the strategy, adhering to SRP.
Flexibility: Strategies can be changed dynamically at runtime.

Example Use Cases

Payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer).
Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort).
Formatting data in different ways (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV).
